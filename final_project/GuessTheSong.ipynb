    "Write code that indefinitely asks the user for search terms (e.g., artist names, track names, etc.). For every search term the user enters, you should add the results from the iTunes API (part 1.1) to a list that tracks all the results. Your code should ask the user for search terms until they enter `'done'`. You should assign the list of results to a variable, which you will reference in part 2.\n",

    "\n",
    "For the second part of this project, you will write code that implements a song-guessing game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2.1: Pick a random song\n",
    "After creating a list of songs (part 1), your code should pick a song at random from that list. You should use  [the `random.choice()` method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice) for this (be sure to import the `random` module).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2.2: Play a song preview\n",
    "\n",
    "After picking a random song (2.1), your code should play an audio preview of the song.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you must import a few features from the `IPython.display` module:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from IPython.display import display, Audio, clear_output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After you do this, if you are given a URL for an audio file (suppose it is in the variable `audio_url`), you can play it with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "display(Audio(audio_url, autoplay=True))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can try this with the audio url: `'https://audio-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/Music7/v4/cd/a8/4c/cda84ca4-3ef1-d2b5-6f88-3640e5db33fc/mzaf_1355556193908011287.plus.aac.p.m4a'`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2.3: Print a \"blanked out\" version of the song:\n",
    "\n",
    "After picking a random song (2.1) and playing a song preview (2.2), your code should\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace every **alphanumeric** character (meaning a-z, 0-9) in the track name with an underscore (`'_'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a song titled `\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\"` should print out: `\"(_ ___'_ ___ __) ____________\"`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\n",
    "(_ ___'_ ___ __) ____________\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check if a character is alphanumeric with the `.isalnum()` method: `'a'.isalnum()` is `True`. `'#'.isalnum()` is `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2.4: Allow the user to guess the track name (or pass)\n",
    "After your code picks a random song (2.1), plays the song preview (2.2), and prints a \"blanked out\" version of the song (2.3), your code should repeatedly ask the user to guess the song. Every time, your code should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ask the user to enter a guess (using `input()`)\n",
    "- If the user guessed the correct track name, print `\"You got it!\"`.\n",
    "- If the user guessed incorrectly, print `\"It's not '<what the user entered>'\"`\n",
    "- If the user enters `'pass'` then your code should display the correct answer (`\"The song was '<track name>'\"`) and stop asking for guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part should **not** be case sensitive; if the correct answer is `'Thriller'` and the user guesses `'THRILLER'`, this should count as being correct. You can use Python strings' [`.upper()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.upper) method to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2.5: Indefinite rounds\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, your code should repeat parts 2.1--2.4 indefinitely (until the user types `'exit'`). Note that this means you will need to have nested `while` loops (one for 2.4 and one for this part). One way to achieve this would be to put the code for part 2.4 into a separate function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every round, your code should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Print `'== ROUND <#> =='`, replacing `<#>` with the round number (`1`,`2`,`3`,...)\n",
    "2. Pick a random song (as implemented for 2.1)\n",
    "3. Play a preview of the song (as implemented for 2.2)\n",
    "4. Print a \"blanked out\" version of the song (as ipmlemented for 2.3)\n",
    "5. Allow the user to guess the song with an indefinite number of chances (as implemented for 2.4), with the following modification:\n",
    "    - If the user types `'exit'`, your code should display the correct answer, wait 3 seconds, and clear the output (see \\#6 for how to do this)\n",
    "    - The user should still be able to enter `'skip'` to skip to the next round. The difference between `'pass'` and `'exit'` is that `'pass'` should move on to the next round. `'exit'` should exit the guessing game entirely.\n",
    "6. After the user guesses correctly (or passes), your code should:\n",
    "    - Display the correct track name (if the user passed)\n",
    "    - Wait 3 seconds (you can do this by importing [the `time` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.sleep) and calling `time.sleep(3)`\n",
    "    - Call `clear_output()` (imported from `IPython.display` earlier) to clean up the output.\n",
    "7. Increment the round and start up again at step 1"

    "### Game principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "When the player is done creating a tracklist and finished the initial game setup, the game is ready. It works as follows:\n",
    " \n",
    " 1. Program prints out whose turn is it + the number of round. \n",
    "     - First, it's Player 1's turn and he guesses **n** songs one after another, where **n** is a number of input rounds, and after he's done guessing, it's Player 2's turn and so on\n",
    "     - Each round a number of remaining lives + a number of remaining hints is printed\n",
    "     - If player has no remaining lives, the guessing part of the game is over for him, printing out his stats (note that he can still win)\n",
    "     - When player's turn is over, his/her stats are printed\n",
    "     \n",
    " 2. Players have 4 options when guessing (not case sensitive):\n",
    "     - 'pass' - skip the song+round and lose live\n",
    "     - 'quit' - quit the game\n",
    "     - 'hint' - use a hint (only if you have some and only once per turn) = displays an image assigned to the song\n",
    "     - try to guess the song (unlimited tries, no time limit)\n",
    "     \n",
    " 3. After all players are finished guessing, the game:\n",
    "     - Prints out the scoreboard (a dictionary)\n",
    "     - Either congratulates to the winner or calls it a draw, according to scoreboard\n",
    "     \n",
    " 4. Players are asked to play again:\n",
    "     - 'no' - quits the game\n",
    "     - 'yes'\n",
    "     \n",
    " 5. If player picks 'yes':\n",
    "     - player's asked if the program should keep the tracklist or not ('yes'/'no')\n",
    "     - if player chooses not to reset the tracklist the game setup will reset tho"
